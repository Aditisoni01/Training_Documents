	Introduction to DevOps :::::
	
	
		Software Applications? Collection of Programs

			Types of Applications ?
				Desktop Applications
				Web Applications
				Mobile Applications
				
		
			How the Applications are developed and Delivered ?
		
		E_Commerce Application ::::
		
		Software Development Life Cycle - SDLC ::::
		
			- Requirement Analysis
			- Design
			- Code/Development
			- Testing
			- Implementation/Deployment
			- Maintainence / Monitor
			
		Water-fall Model ::: --> Linear in approach

			E_Commerce Application ::::		--> 9 Months

		Agile Methodologies ::: 
		
		E_Commerce Application ::::
			10 Modules +5 
		
		Modules / Iterations / Functions ::
		
		Iteration1:
			- Requirement Analysis
			- Design
			- Code/Development					*.java () - build - UT - promote the app to test envi.
			- Testing

			- Implementation/Deployment
			- Maintainence / Monitor
			
		Iteration 1.1:
			- Requirement Analysis
			- Design

		Agile Methodologies can able to achieve :::
		
				Continous Development
				Continous Integration
				Continous Testing 
				Continous Delivery		-		Always expects Approval for Production Release.
				
		Agile Methodologies can't able to achieve :::
			
				Continous Deployment	-		It is completely Automated - No Approvals are needed for Production Release.
				
			Why we Need approvals for Prod release ???
			
				
	
	
		DevOps :::
		
			--> Is a software development strategy, which promotes the collaborations between the teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continous Development, Continous Integration, Continous Testing, Continous Delivery, Continous Deployment and Continous Monitoring in more automated fashion.
			
		Teams ::: 
			
			Infra-structure Management Team ==> Provision the Servers/Configure the Tools 
			Development Team -> Application Owners/Architects/Leads/Developers ==> Create/Code Application
			Testing Team ==> QA/UAT 
			Release Management Team ==>  to prod releases
			Production Support Team
			Production Monitoring 
			Security Team
			
			DevOps Team ::::
			
				Infra-structure Management Team ==> Provision the Servers/Configure the Tools 
				Development Team -> Application Owners/Architects/Leads/Developers ==> Create/Code Application
				Testing Team ==> QA/UAT 
				Release Management Team ==>  to prod releases
				Production Support Team
				Production Monitoring 
				Security Team
				
			DevOps Team ::::  --> DevOps Asso. / Sr. Asso. / DevOps Engg./ Leads/ DevOps Architects / Consultants
			
	Tele-Comm Domain :::
			SP1 ==> Wants to introduce a new service/offer to their customers. IT
			SP2 ==> Wants to introduce a new service/offer to their customers. IT
			
		DevOps Stages ::: ==> DevSecOps
		
		DevOps Stages :::
		
			Infra-structure Management Team ::
				--> Server Provisioning 	-- IAC Tools --> Terraform
				--> Server Configuration 	-- IAC Tools Ansible --> Configuration Management Tools
		
		
			Continous Development :::
				It is the capability of the Dev Team to continously develop the code.
					- Coding 	Java -- HLL
					
					- Build --> Process of Compiling the src_code & Create Artifacts(Binaries) - *.war/*.jar/*.dll/*.exec
					- Unit Testing 
					- Promote the artifacts to Test environment
					- Notify the Testing Team to pick up the app for further testing.
				
				Using DevOps Process/tools, we can automate everything from build stage.
				
					Tools like ::: IDEs - Integrated Development Environment - Eclipse / Visual Studio Code/Visual Studio / Pycharm/
									Build --> Maven / Gradle / ant
									Source Code Repository -- GIT - Used to Version Controll the src code.
									Jenkins 
									
			Continous Integration :::	It is the capability of integrating the code for further testing.
						Jenkins, docker / Kubernetes 
			
			Continous Testing
						Automated Testing - TestNG / Selinium --> Jenkins 
						QA 		-- Quality Assurance 
						UAT     -- User Acceptance Testing

			
			Continous Delivery/Continous Deployment ==> Jenkins, Docker/Kubernetes, Ansible, docker / Kubernetes 
			
					Both Continous Delivery/Continous Deployment are refers to Prod Release.
						If you manually approve the prod release - Continous Delivery
						If you automate the prod release without any manual Intervension - Continous Deployment
			
			Continous Monitoring			
						Infra-structure monitoring
								--> Jenkins, Prometheus/Grafana/DynaTrace/Nagios,..........
						Application Monitoring 
								--> AppDyanamics
								
			Script Language :::
				Groovy scripts 
				python scripts
				yaml scripts 
				shell scripts
				
				
			UseCase ::::
			
			Appication Architecture ::::
				
					--> Monolith Application Architecture
								The Application Components/function/Modules are tightly coupled
					
					--> Micro Service based Application Architecture
								The Application Components/function/Modules are loosely coupled
								These Modules are called as services.

		Banking :::					--> Continous Delivery!
			Online Banking	
			Credit Online Service :::
			
				Open a Productio Release Window --> 4 - 6hrs. --> Non-Business Hours   --> Download time!
				
						Deployed --> Issue 
											--> 1. Try to Fix the issue. 
											--> 2. Revert.

			In order to achieve Continous Deployment --> we shd have a matured level of DevOps.
			
		DevOps is not about tools 
		
			DevOps is all about the People, Process and Tools 
			
			--> About Continous Improvement!
			
			--> Detailed DevOps Assessment!
			
			--> You should always search the scope for automation.

Source Code Management System / Version Control System ::::::

		GIT --> 
		
		Source Code :::
		
		*.html / *.css / 
		
		index.jsp 			== >Save this pgm in a folder/ ==> e:/project_workspace/index.jsp
		
		<html>
			asdf
			asdfa
			sd
			fashiondf
			aasdfasdfasdfasdfsd
			asdffsa
			dfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf
			scopedf
			sdf
			asdffas
			d
			adfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf
			asdfasdfasdfas
			asdfasdfasdfa
		</html>
		
		
		Save the same file using Version Control System ::::
		
		index.html 		==> v1.0
		index.html 		==> v1.2
		index.html 		==> v1.3		--> Tag/Commit_ID/Version
		index.html 		==> v1.4
						
						
			GIT is one of the Open Source Distributed Version Control System :::
			
				--> It is used to track the changes.
				--> It is used to version control the Changes.
				--> It is used to perform Parallel Development.
				
			github		==> Remote GIT Repository
			gitlab
			bitbucket
			azure repos
			aws codecommit 
			
			
		Repository ::: --> Collection of Folders/Files
		
	
		github		==> Remote GIT Repository
		https://github.com/
